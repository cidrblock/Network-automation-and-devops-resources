While there is nothing really shocking new to this branching model, the “big picture” figure that this post began with has turned out to be tremendously useful in our projects. It forms an elegant mental model that is easy to comprehend and allows team members to develop a shared understanding of the branching and releasing processes.

### PYTHON

Ok, so python is this thing called a programming language. It takes text that you’ve written (usually referred to as code), turns it into instructions for your computer, and runs those instructions. We’ll be learning how to write code to do cool and useful stuff. No longer will you be bound to use others’ programs to do things with your computer - you can make your own!

### JSON, YAML, AND MARKDOWN

JSON is a syntax for storing and exchanging data.

http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp

This page provides a basic overview of correct YAML syntax, which is how Ansible playbooks (our configuration management language) are expressed.

http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/YAMLSyntax.html

YAML (/ˈjæməl/, rhymes with camel) is a human-readable data serialization language.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML

Paste in your YAML and click "Go" - we'll tell you if it's valid or not, and give you a nice clean UTF-8 version of it.
